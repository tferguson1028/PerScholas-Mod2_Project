1. 
Generate my name with a random font for every letter to the sound of music.
The fonts will be fetched from Google's font API
The music will be generated by a music generation API


2.
Card game against an AI that uses APIs to make decisions. 

The cards would be created from my name, with 2 cards comming from each letter.

The AI uses and computer vision API to see what is on the screen
and uses that data to determine what do next.

<!-- ! Natural language processing is too hard, forget about this and just let user click on buttons -->
<!--// The AI would use a text generation API -->
<!--// The player would input actions using a text parsing API -->

The games would be Go-Fish, Blackjack <!--Hate this game -->, and Poker.
