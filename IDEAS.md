Play pong against AI that uses computer vision. Over time the player and AI get new abilities.

Card game against an AI that uses APIs to make decisions. 

The cards would be created from my name, with 2 cards comming from each letter.

The AI uses and computer vision API to see what is on the screen
and uses that data to determine what do next.

<!-- ! Natural language processing is too hard, forget about this and just let user click on buttons -->
<!--// The AI would use a text generation API -->
<!--// The player would input actions using a text parsing API -->

The games would be Go-Fish, Blackjack <!--Hate this game -->, and Poker.
